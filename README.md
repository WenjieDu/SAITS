> SAITS now is available in [PyPOTS](https://github.com/WenjieDu/PyPOTS), a Python toolbox for data mining on POTS (Partially-Observed Time Series). An example of training SAITS for imputing dataset PhysioNet-2012 is shown below. With [PyPOTS](https://github.com/WenjieDu/PyPOTS), easy peasy! üòâ 

<details>
  <summary><b>üëâ Click here to see the example üëÄ</b></summary>

``` python
# Install PyPOTS first: pip install pypots
import numpy as np
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from pypots.data import load_specific_dataset, mcar, masked_fill
from pypots.imputation import SAITS
from pypots.utils.metrics import cal_mae
# Data preprocessing. Tedious, but PyPOTS can help. ü§ì
data = load_specific_dataset('physionet_2012')  # For datasets in PyPOTS database, PyPOTS will automatically download and extract it.
X = data['X']
num_samples = len(X['RecordID'].unique())
X = X.drop('RecordID', axis = 1)
X = StandardScaler().fit_transform(X.to_numpy())
X = X.reshape(num_samples, 48, -1)
X_intact, X, missing_mask, indicating_mask = mcar(X, 0.1) # hold out 10% observed values as ground truth
X = masked_fill(X, 1 - missing_mask, np.nan)
# Model training. This is PyPOTS showtime. üí™
saits = SAITS(n_steps=48, n_features=37, n_layers=2, d_model=256, d_inner=128, n_head=4, d_k=64, d_v=64, dropout=0.1, epochs=10)
saits.fit(X)  # train the model. Here I use the whole dataset as the training set, because ground truth is not visible to the model.
imputation = saits.impute(X)  # impute the originally-missing values and artificially-missing values
mae = cal_mae(imputation, X_intact, indicating_mask)  # calculate mean absolute error on the ground truth (artificially-missing values)
```

‚¶ø **`Motivation`**: SAITS is developed primarily to help overcome the drawbacks (slow speed, memory constraints, and compounding error) of RNN-based imputation models and to obtain the state-of-the-art (SOTA) imputation accuracy on partially-observed time series.

‚¶ø **`Performance`**: SAITS outperforms [BRITS](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2018/hash/734e6bfcd358e25ac1db0a4241b95651-Abstract.html) by **12% ‚àº 38%** in MAE (mean absolute error) and achieves **2.0 ‚àº 2.6** times faster training speed. Furthermore, SAITS outperforms Transformer (trained by our joint-optimization approach) by **2% ‚àº 19%** in MAE with a more efficient model structure (to obtain comparable performance, SAITS needs only **15% ‚àº 30%** parameters of Transformer). Compared to another SOTA self-attention imputation model [NRTSI](https://github.com/lupalab/NRTSI), SAITS achieves **7% ‚àº 39%** smaller mean squared error (<ins>above 20% in nine out of sixteen cases</ins>), meanwhile, needs much fewer parameters and less imputation time in practice. Please refer to our [full paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.08516.pdf) for more details about SAITS' performance.

## ‚ùñ Brief Graphical Illustration of Our Methodology
Here we only show the two main components of our method: the joint-optimization training approach and SAITS structure. For the detailed description and explanation, please read our [full paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.08516.pdf).

## ‚ùñ Repository Structure
The implementation of SAITS is in dir [`modeling`](https://github.com/WenjieDu/SAITS/blob/master/modeling/SA_models.py). We give configurations of our models in dir [`configs`](https://github.com/WenjieDu/SAITS/tree/master/configs), provide the dataset links and preprocessing scripts in dir [`dataset_generating_scripts`](https://github.com/WenjieDu/SAITS/tree/master/dataset_generating_scripts). Dir [`NNI_tuning`](https://github.com/WenjieDu/SAITS/tree/master/NNI_tuning) contains the hyper-parameter searching configurations.

## ‚ùñ Development Environment
All dependencies of our development environment are listed in file [`conda_env_dependencies.yml`](https://github.com/WenjieDu/SAITS/blob/master/conda_env_dependencies.yml). You can quickly create a
usable python environment with an anaconda command `conda env create -f conda_env_dependencies.yml`. **‚ùóÔ∏èNote that this file is for Linux platform with GPU,** but you still can use it for reference of dependency libraries.

## ‚ùñ Datasets
For datasets downloading and generating, please check out the scripts in dir [`dataset_generating_scripts`](https://github.com/WenjieDu/SAITS/tree/master/dataset_generating_scripts).

## ‚ùñ Quick Run
Generate the dataset you need first. To do so, please check out the generating scripts in dir [`dataset_generating_scripts`](https://github.com/WenjieDu/SAITS/tree/master/dataset_generating_scripts).

After data generation, train and test your model, for example,

```bash
# create a dir to save logs and results
mkdir NIPS_results

# train a model
nohup python run_models.py \
    --config_path configs/PhysioNet2012_SAITS_best.ini \
    > NIPS_results/PhysioNet2012_SAITS_best.out &

# during training, you can run the blow command to read the training log
less NIPS_results/PhysioNet2012_SAITS_best.out

# after training, pick the best model and modify the path of the model for testing in the config file, then run the below command to test the model
python run_models.py \
    --config_path configs/PhysioNet2012_SAITS_best.ini \
    --test_mode
```

‚ùóÔ∏èNote that paths of datasets and saving dirs may be different on personal computers, please check them in the configuration files.
